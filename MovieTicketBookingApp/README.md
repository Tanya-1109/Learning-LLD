# Movie Ticket Booking App Using LLD 
NOTE :
- I have taken the UML and the code from youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FiaSThCw8&ab_channel=MrunmaiDahare] for my understanding of how everything works but the code is written by me since I wanted Java implementation.
- From this we will get a basic idea how to start in an interview when given this design.

## Requirements

1. **Admin Access:**  
   Admin has the authority to add or remove movies.

2. **Movie Management:**  
   Controls the duration of movies and manages seat availability for each theatre.

3. **Booking Flow:**  
   Users can select their location, choose a movie, pick desired seats, and choose a payment method.

4. **Ticket Generation:**  
   After payment, users receive a ticket for their selected movie and seats.
