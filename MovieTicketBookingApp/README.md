# Movie Ticket Booking App Using LLD 
NOTE :
- I have taken the UML and the code from youtube - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2FiaSThCw8&ab_channel=MrunmaiDahare] for my understanding of how everything works but the code is written by me since I wanted Java implementation.
- From this we will get a basic idea how to start in an interview when given this design.

## Requirements

1. Admin Access - Admin has the authority to add, remove movies.
2. Movie Management - Controls the duration of the movie along with the seats available for a particular theatre.
3. Booking Flow - The user has the authority to select its location, choose the movie, select the desired seats and make the choice of payment.
4. Ticket Generation - After the payment, the user should get a generated ticket for its choice of movie and seats.
